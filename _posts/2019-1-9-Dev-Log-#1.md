title: Appointment App Dev Log #1
---

To begin with, I created a Database Schema:

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/unnamed.png)

Afterwards I used the express generator to generate the app. 

`$ npm install express-generator -g`

Then I created the project.

`$ express --view=pug appointmentScheduler`.

Afterwards I connected to my local mongo server and started listening with a simple
``` 
mongoose.connect(URL, {useNewUrlParser: true}))
  .then(() => {
    app.listen(4000);
  }
  ```

I'm in the process of adding routes and writing optimized queries. Dev Log #2 will have a little more in the way of that.
